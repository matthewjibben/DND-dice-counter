The purpose of this program is to take an input number of dice and their number of sides, and find all possible values of a roll and their probabilities based on all possible rolls.
For example, with 2d6 it is possible to have a roll value of 2, but it is unlikely because there is only one combination that makes that value (1+1). A value of 6 however, is most 
common with 6 possible combinations: (1+6), (2+5), (3+4), (4+3), (5+2), (6+1). With this program, I can find all values and their number of combinations for any number of dice with
any number of sides. The intended purpose of the program is to find which D&D spells are best to use.

Future features to add:
I plan to add a gui for user input using the 'tkinter' library, and have a graphical display of the results using 'matplotlib.pyplot'
(completed)
possibly display the probabilities of each roll as a pie chart, or list all values and their percent probabilities
